    <h1>ThreatSlayer</h1>

    <h2>Web3 security for everyone</h2>

    <p>Over $7 billion worth of crypto was stolen in 2021 alone.
    ThreatSlayer protects your crypto assets by blocking phishing sites from taking your passwords or seed phrases.
    In the future, ThreatSlayer will be powered by our token: $ILOCK.</p>

    <h2>Enterprise-grade security</h2>

    <p>The technology behind ThreatSlayer is already used by large companies in the web3 space. 
    Companies you've heard of. We built ThreatSlayer so users like you can be protected as much as the big guys.
    Because web3 needs security if it's going to grow and thrive.</p>

    <h2>How does ThreatSlayer terminate threats?</h2>

    <p>Interlock scans new URLs 24/7, every day, with our proprietary Visual AI.
    When we find a new website that's an exact visual copy of an existing one, we flag it as a phishing site.
    Those sites get blocked by ThreatSlayer and our Discord security bot, Bouncer.</p>
