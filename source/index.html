    <h1>ThreatSlayer</h1>

    <h2>Web3 security for everyone</h2>

    <p>Over $7 billion worth of crypto was stolen in 2021 alone.
    ThreatSlayer protects your crypto assets by blocking phishing sites from taking your passwords or seed phrases.
    In the future, ThreatSlayer will be powered by $ILOCK, our token coming in 2023.</p>

    <h2>How does ThreatSlayer terminate threats?</h2>

    <p>Interlock scans new URLs 24/7, every day, with our proprietary Visual AI.
    When we find a new website that's an exact visual copy of an existing one, we flag it as a phishing site.
    Those sites get blocked by ThreatSlayer.</p>

    <h2>Enterprise-grade security</h2>

    <p>Some of the biggest companies in web3 already use the Interlock tech that powers ThreatSlayer. 
    Companies you've heard of. We built ThreatSlayer so users like you can be protected as much as the big guys.</p>
