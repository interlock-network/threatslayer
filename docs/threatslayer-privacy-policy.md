# ThreatSlayer Data Privacy Policy

This document will cover the ThreatSlayer data collected and used by Interlock, a web3 security company.

## ThreatSlayer

ThreatSlayer is a browser extension by Interlock. It protects users from malicious websites. Registered users will be eligible to receive Interlock's $ILOCK token for browsing. 

When ThreatSlayer is running in your browser, it runs scripts to:

1. Send your URL to our backend to see if the site is malicious.

2. If the site *is* malicious, to block the site so you don’t give it sensitive information.

3. *For users who register with us*, a unique API key associated with that user is sent together with the URL in order to accurately calculate rewards for that user.

Note: Users do not need to register in order to use and be protected by ThreatSlayer. But only registered users will be rewarded for browsing. 

ThreatSlayer is an open source project – you can see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/interlock-network/threatslayer), including the code for the scripts.

## Data We Collect for Scanning URLs

Interlock maintains a backend pipeline that classifies URLs as safe or unsafe. To do so, we collect and retain certain kinds of data. This data is not considered personally identifiable information (PII), and thus is not protected under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or similar legislation. This includes:

* Dynamically rendered heuristic assets (i.e. favicons made by JS, instead of static)

* Query string parameters will be stripped from the target URL in the link object

## Data We Collect for Token Rewards

Interlock's business is based on protecting users with ThreatSlayer while identifying malicious URLs. We therefore reward registered ThreatSlayer users for the URLs they browse, especially malicious ones. In order to reward users fairly, we collect the following data:

* The username, password, and web3 account ID users register with

* The username of the user who first navigates to a new URL (malicious or not)

## Analytics Data

Interlock will collect and retain the following information for URL classification:

* Resolvable URLs

* The data generated by Interlock about the link (classification as safe or unsafe, etc.)

* Analytics data is stored indefinitely

## Data Anonymization and Deletion Policy

Analytics data will be disassociated from the user who generated it.

For example, if a user posts a safe URL, Interlock will retain the URL and the “safe” classification in case another user posts the same URL in the future, but will not retain any association between that safe URL and the user who posted it.

This protects users who post links to safe websites like Planned Parenthood who get their records subpoenaed by a state or country where abortion is illegal.

## Data Processing

Discord message event data is processed on DigitalOcean infrastructure located in the United States. It is stored in a Digital Ocean virtual machine that is only accessible to Interlock employees. Discord mods can access Bouncer settings for their own Discord servers via HTTPS.
