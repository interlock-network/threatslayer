# ThreatSlayer Data Privacy Policy

This document will cover the ThreatSlayer data collected and used by Interlock, a web3 security company.

## ThreatSlayer

ThreatSlayer is a browser extension by Interlock. It protects users from malicious websites. Registered users will be eligible to receive Interlock's $ILOCK token for browsing. 

When ThreatSlayer is running in your browser, it:

1. Sends the URL you are browsing to our backend to check if the URL is safe.

2. Blocks URLs that we detect are malicious, to protect you from entering sensitive information.

3. (For users who register with us) Sends a unique key together with the URL in order to accurately calculate rewards for you.

Note: You do not need to register in order to use and be protected by ThreatSlayer. But only registered users will be rewarded for browsing. 

ThreatSlayer is an open source project – you can see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/interlock-network/threatslayer), including the code for the scripts.

## Data We Store for Scanning URLs

Interlock maintains a backend classifier that classifies URLs as safe or malicious. To do so, we collect and retain certain kinds of data. This data is not considered personally identifiable information (PII), and thus is not protected under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or similar legislation. This includes:

* Contents of the page

* Query string parameters will be stripped from the target URL in the link object

## User Data We Store for Token Rewards

Interlock's business is based on protecting users with ThreatSlayer while identifying malicious URLs. We therefore reward registered ThreatSlayer users for the URLs they browse, especially malicious ones. In order to reward users fairly, we store the following data:

* The username, a password hash, and web3 account ID users register with

* The URLs registered users visit

## Analytics Data

Interlock will store the following information for URL classification:

* Resolvable URLs

* The data generated by Interlock about the link (classification as safe or malicious, etc.)

* Analytics data may be stored indefinitely

## Data Anonymization and Deletion Policy

If a user posts a safe URL, Interlock will retain the URL and the “safe” classification in case another user posts the same URL in the future.

If a user wishes for anonymity, they can use Interlock ThreatSlayer without registering. In this case, there will be no data collected saving the connection between their browsing activity, and them.

## Data Processing

Discord message event data is processed on DigitalOcean infrastructure located in the United States. It is stored in a Digital Ocean virtual machine that is only accessible to Interlock employees.
